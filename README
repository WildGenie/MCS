Media Center Studio is a wonderful tool for Media Center users.  Unfortunately the developer of it disappeared, more than likely killed by Jason Bourne.  Since he's failed to return my phone calls that I never made I did the only thing that seemed appropriate.  I helped his executables return to their original form: code.  So, the original design of this beast is not mine.
